# 📦 API Converter System  

A school project that develops an **API conversion system** to help small companies manage supplier APIs more efficiently. Product data often comes in inconsistent formats, which makes integration difficult. This tool converts API responses into a **clean, structured JSON format** — and can also return **structured HTML** ready for rendering — while letting you **choose exactly which keys to extract** (e.g., price, image, material).

## ✨ Features  
- Choose custom keys from supplier APIs  
- Consistent **JSON** output for easy integration  
- Optional **structured HTML** output for render-ready product blocks  
- Works with multiple suppliers and product categories  
- Lightweight and simple to implement  

---

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. Connect the supplier’s API  
2. Define which fields (keys) you want to extract  
3. Select output: **JSON** (default) or **HTML**  
4. Receive a simplified payload containing only those fields

## 🚀 Use Cases  

This system is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different business needs. Some example use cases include:  

### 🛒 E-commerce Websites  
Unify product data from multiple suppliers into a single consistent format, making it easier to display and manage large product catalogs.  

### 🏷️ Render-Ready Snippets  
Generate structured **HTML blocks** for product cards, email templates, or CMS embeds without writing custom code for each supplier API.  

### 🔄 Data Integration Pipelines  
Transform messy and inconsistent API responses into standardized JSON or HTML that can be passed into other systems or services.  

### 📊 Inventory Management  
Extract only the most relevant fields (e.g., `price`, `stock`, `material`) to sync supplier data with internal databases or ERP systems.  

### 🌍 Multi-Supplier Platforms  
Keep a unified structure across different product categories and suppliers, reducing complexity and improving scalability.
